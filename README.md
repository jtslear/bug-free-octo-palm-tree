# Elixirlight
## Goals
* [ ] Learn Elixir
* [ ] Learn Phoenix
* [ ] Interface with a Raspberry Pi Zero
* [ ] Configure this app to change the color of a connected light string

## Stretch Goals
* [ ] Do something fun to handle an idle choice
* [ ] Utilize a timer and/or quick on/off feature
* [ ] Embed this into the Pi using Nerves
  * Can nerves provide any PWM capabilities?
  * Is there any other way I can interface with the light string beyond
    [ServoBlaster](https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster)?
  * I'll need wireless working...

To start the Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
